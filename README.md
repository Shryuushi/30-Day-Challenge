    Screens.

    it a little to fit the theme of the project. It also utilized nested
    stack navigation.

# Grocery List Screen :
    I used the old outline for the previous project we did, and redesigned

# Calendar Screen :
    This screen utilizes the calendar package, I utilized some of the base 
    code provided by the github details for this specific package, redefined 
    them to useState protocol and designed it to fix the theme of the App. I
    also added a nested navigation protocol to utilize the Stack drawer to go
    to the Exercise Screen on click.
